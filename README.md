### What is this project about?
```
- Collection of really useful environment/setup files 
```
### What are the key learnings for me in this project?
```
- Always try to automate as much as possible
- Use just the really important files. 
  - If you don't have >50 alias you aren't in need to use the .bash_aliases file :)
  - Saves you some clutter and typing
```
### What you should learn from my mistakes during development?
```
- Mac uses the .bash_profile :) 
- You have to use the .bashrc in the .bash_profile 
  - Suggeston: Delete your .bashrc and only use .bash_profile on macintosh
